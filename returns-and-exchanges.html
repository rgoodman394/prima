<h1>Returns & Exchanges</h1>
<h2>Our Return Policy</h2>
<p>We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase from Prima. However, we understand that things don’t
always work out every single time you buy a product. Experience has shown returns can be difficult and costly when an
item is purchased online, so we've designed our return process to be as simple and user-friendly as possible. Many
items on our site qualify for our Prima Returns Policy.</p>
<h2>Items Qualified for Our Prima Returns Policy</h2>
<ul style="list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 1rem;">
	<li>Items marked with our "Prima Returns" badge are eligible for return under our Prima Returns Policy.</li>
	<li>You must request an RMA within 30 days of receiving your shipment, and you must ship the item back to us within 5
	business days of receiving your RMA number.</li>
	<li>Items must be in new condition and packaged in the original manufacturer’s packaging.</li>
	<li>You will receive a refund for the original purchase price as indicated on the original sales invoice, minus a 25%
	restocking fee.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Set up a Return for an Item</h2>
<p>Our return process is arranged in three simple steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 1rem;">
	<li><a href="https://primasupply.com/contact-us"><strong>Contact us</strong></a> to set up a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number. Eligible items may be
	returned as outlined in our return policy details.</li>
	<li><strong>Return eligible items</strong> as instructed by your customer service representative.</li>
	<li><strong>Notify us</strong> when you have shipped the eligible items and include the name of the freight carrier
	and the tracking number of the return shipment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your credit will typically be issued within 5 business days from receipt of shipment for Prima Returns items that
are returned to Prima’s facility.</p>
<p><em>Please note: eligible items require a Return Merchandise Authorization number to receive return credit. Items
without an authorization number will not receive return credit.</em></p>
<p><em>Please note: we highly recommend that you purchase shipping insurance to cover the value of the item to protect
against damage in transit. Units that arrive damaged will not be eligible for a refund.</em></p>
<h2>Items Not Qualified for Our Prima Returns Policy</h2>
<ul style="list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 1rem;">
	<li>Items not marked with our "Prima Returns" badge are governed by the <strong>manufacturer's</strong> return
	policy.</li>
	<li><em>We cannot guarantee that these products can be returned, so please call us before purchasing if you have any
	questions.</em></li>
	<li>If your item is able to be returned to the manufacturer, please allow 4-8 weeks for your return credit to be
	issued.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Parts Not Qualified for Our Prima Returns Policy</h2>
<ul style="list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 1rem;">
	<li>Parts that are used cannot be returned.</li>
	<li>Parts that do not have the original manufacturer's packaging cannot be returned.</li>
	<li>Select electrical parts cannot be returned - <em>please check with us when requesting an RMA.</em> Examples
	include, but are not limited to:
		<ul>
			<li>Fan Motors (condenser or evaporator)</li>
			<li>Lighting</li>
			<li>Ballast</li>
			<li>Start Kits (Relays, Overloads, Start Capacitors)</li>
			<li>Temp Controls that require programming (once programmed these cannot be unprogrammed, and therefore cannot be
			returned)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Please note that manufactuers change what they will or will not accept returns on from time to time. For items
	that do not ship from our warehouse we will need to check with the manufacturer before accepting a return. Each
	manufacturer has different return policies which supersede the terms and conditions of our return policy.</li>
</ul>
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>Is there a restocking fee?</h2>
<ul style="list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 1rem;">
	<li>A 25% restocking fee will be deducted from the return credit for items that qualify for our Prima Returns
	Policy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why charge a restocking fee?</h2>
<ul style="list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 1rem;">
	<li>The restocking fee helps us keep prices low. There are high shipping and handling costs associated with processing
	returns, and we don’t want to pass those costs on to every one of our customers through higher prices. By charging a
	restocking fee on returned items only, we’re able to provide an affordable and enjoyable shopping experience for our
	customers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who is responsible for return shipping costs?</h2>
<ul style="list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 1rem;">
	<li>The customer is responsible for return shipping costs unless the wrong item was shipped.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What about damaged and incorrect items?</h2>
<ul style="list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 1rem;">
	<li>If the item is damaged in-transit, please see our shipping policy for how to handle damaged products. We always
	encourage customers to call our office the moment damage is discovered in order to achieve the best outcome.</li>
	<li>We make every effort to ship out the right item the first time, but in the event that we ship out a wrong item we
	will take care of shipping the item back and shipping out the correct order right away.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why can’t some items be returned?</h2>
<ul style="list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 1rem;">
	<li>Special-order items are not kept in our inventory and must be purchased by Prima Supply specifically for an
	individual customer’s order. Given the economic impact of returning non-inventory items to stock, we do not permit
	returns of special-order items.</li>
	<li>Used items and items that do not have the original manufacturer packaging may not be returned as they cannot be
	resold as new at full price.</li>
	<li>Local and Federal regulations make returns on certain items very difficult. For that reason some items may not be
	returnable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Can I talk to someone about the return requirements and returnability of an item?</h2>
<ul style="list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 1rem;">

<h2>Can I cancel an order?</h2>

	representatives will work with you to cancel your order.</li>
	<li>Orders may not be canceled by email, voicemail, or the website contact form.</li>
	<li>Please note: <em>any order may be canceled before we process the order for fulfillment (i.e. before we setup the
	shipment or send the order to a partner for production and/or shipment). Cancellation requests made after the order is
	processed will be handled the same way as a return and will be governed by the indicated return policy on the product
	listing.</em></li>
