<h1>Customer Service</h1>


<p>Prima Supply comes from a long line of family owned and locally operated companies. We've been operating out of
Louisville KY since 1947 and are committed to customer satisfaction and a great online shopping experience. All calls
and inquiries are handled by our dedicated customer service team in our Louisville office. When you give us a call, you
won't have to wade through an endless phone system maze in order to get the information you need. Rather, your inquiry
will be personally handled by a trained and friendly live support team. Just because you're shopping online does not
mean that you can't enjoy the benefits of interacting with a real person. So contact us today!</p>
