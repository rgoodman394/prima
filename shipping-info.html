    <h2>Small Packages That Ship by Parcel</h2>
        <p>
        Small packages weighing less than 70 pounds and measuring less than 72 inches
        on the longest side will ship via UPS, FedEx, USPS, or similar parcel delivery
        service, depending on your location in relation to the order fulfillment site
        and the delivery method chosen during checkout. Please note that our deadline
        for expedited orders to ship out same day is 12:00PM ET. Non-expedited orders
        placed by this time should go out same or next day.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Delivery Service</h3>
            <h4>Standard Delivery:</h4>
                <p>
                Our shipping partners offer standard ground-based delivery service with
                delivery times ranging from 3-7 business days after shipment. Items marked as
                eligible for our free shipping offer will be shipped with standard delivery
                service. Free shipping only applies to the contiguous U.S. (HI & AK not
                included). Other delivery services and options will incur additional fees.
                Once an order has been shipped, we cannot change the delivery service while
                the package is in-transit.
                </p>
            <h4>Two-Day Expedited Delivery:</h4>
                <p>
                Our shipping partners offer two day expedited delivery options, guaranteeing
                in most cases to arrive at your location two business days after shipment.
                Two-day expedited delivery is available for an additional fee. See the
                shipping options during checkout or contact our office by email at <a href="mailto:sales@primasupply.com">sales@primasupply.com</a>. Once an order has been shipped, we cannot change the delivery
                service while the package is in-transit. For in-stock items our deadline to
                get these out same day is 12:00PM ET.
                </p>
            <h4>Next-Day Expedited Delivery:</h4>
                <p>
                Our shipping partners offer next-day expedited delivery options, guaranteeing
                delivery in most cases on the next business day following the date the
                shipment is picked up by the carrier. Next-day expedited delivery is available
                for an additional fee. See the shipping options during checkout or contact our
                office by email at <a href="mailto:sales@primasupply.com">sales@primasupply.com</a>. Once an order has been shipped, we
                cannot change the delivery service while the package is in-transit. For
                in-stock items, our deadline to get these out same day is 12:00PM ET.
                </p>
        <h3>Upgraded Delivery Options</h3>
            <h4>Saturday Delivery</h4>
                <p>
                Some of our shipping partners offer an option for Saturday delivery. An extra
                fee may apply for this service.
                </p>
            <h4>Signature Confirmation:</h4>
                <p>
                Our shipping partners offer extra security by ensuring the delivery is
                accepted with a signature rather than leaving the package unattended at the
                delivery location. An extra fee may apply for this service.
                </p>
            <h4>Shipment Tracking Information:</h4>
                <p>
                Once your order has been fulfilled, we will send tracking information by
                email. The email message will contain the name of the carrier, along with the
                tracking number(s) for your shipment and the carrier’s contact information.
                You may contact us at anytime with questions about the status of your order
                by email at <a href="mailto:sales@primasupply.com">sales@primasupply.com</a>.
                </p>
        <h3>Damage Claims</h3>
            <p>
            Despite our best efforts to provide a smooth and damage-free delivery, items
            shipped by parcel carriers will, at times, incur damage during transit. If you
            notice significant damage to the packaging, we encourage you to review the
            condition of the item before receiving the shipment. This procedure is not
            always possible, particularly at non-commercial delivery locations where the
            shipment may be dropped-off without signature confirmation. If the damage is
            discovered after the shipment has been delivered, contact our office at <a href="mailto:sales@primasupply.com">sales@primasupply.com</a> to discuss your options. In most cases, we can ship a
            replacement item at no-charge and handle the damage claim with the carrier
            directly. Certain limitations apply on high-value items. Please call our
            office at if you have further questions about our small parcel damage claim
            procedure.
            </p>

    <h2>Items That Ship by Freight Carrier</h2>
        <p>
        We partner with a variety of freight carriers. If your order weighs more than
        70 pounds or measures more than 72 inches on the longest side, we may choose
        to ship via freight common carrier. This means that your shipment will be
        delivered on a semitrailer (commonly called a tractor-trailer or
        eighteen-wheeler) and will thus require either a loading dock, forklift truck,
        optional lift gate delivery service, or brute strength to lower your equipment
        from the semitrailer truck bed to ground level. Please note, the typical
        height of a semitrailer truck bed is four feet off ground level, making it
        challenging to unload heavy or tall items without a loading dock or forklift
        truck. Lift gate delivery service, discussed below, may be purchased at the
        time of order to ensure safe unloading during delivery. It is the customer’s
        responsibility to remove the product from the truck; the freight truck driver
        may only move the cargo to the back of the truck but will not help remove the
        item from the truck.
        </p>
        <h3>Delivery Services</h3>
            <h4>Standard Delivery:</h4>
                <p>
                Our shipping partners offer standard ground-based delivery service. Items
                marked as eligible for our free shipping offer will be shipped with standard
                delivery service. Delivery transit times typically range from 3-7 business
                days after shipment. Transit times are estimates only and are not guaranteed.
                Standard commercial freight delivery assumes the customer has a dock or
                forklift to aid removal of freight from the truck; the driver is only
                responsible to move the freight to the back of the trailer. Additional
                delivery options, including lift gate delivery service, may be purchased for
                an additional fee. Lift gate delivery service will not be included unless it
                is purchased with your order; see the shipping options during checkout or
                contact our office by email at <a href="mailto:sales@primasupply.com">sales@primasupply.com</a>. Once an order has been
                shipped, we cannot change the delivery service while the package is
                in-transit.
                </p>
            <h4>Expedited Delivery:</h4>
                <p>
                Expedited delivery service is offered by some of our carriers for select
                shipments and select delivery locations. Expedited shipments are guaranteed in
                most cases. Transit times vary for expedited delivery, depending on the
                delivery location and the service level requested. Contact our customer
                service team at <a href="mailto:sales@primasupply.com">sales@primasupply.com</a> to discuss expedited delivery options,
                including transit times and pricing. As with standard delivery, expedited
                delivery is designed for delivery locations equipped with a loading dock or
                forklift truck on-site.
                </p>
            <h4>Non-Commercial Delivery:</h4>
                <p>
                Our shipping partners strongly recommend a commercial delivery location due to
                the difficulty, danger, and risk of property damage involved in driving a
                semitrailer truck into a limited-access, non-commercial area. If you do not
                have access to a commercial delivery location, we have the ability to ship to
                a residential address. We provide this service at no extra charge, but
                disclaim liability for property damage or personal harm resulting from
                non-recommended delivery location. This service is valued at nearly $100 and
                will often be added to your invoice by other retailers in this marketplace. We
                are pleased to offer this premium delivery service to our customers at
                no-charge, making a purchase from Prima Supply an even greater value. We
                highly recommend that you add liftgate service when shipping to a
                non-commercial address.
                </p>
        <h3>Upgraded Delivery Options</h3>
            <h4>Liftgate Delivery:</h4>
                <p>
                Liftgate delivery is a premium delivery service which provides delivery with a
                special hydraulic platform called a liftgate or tail gate. The driver is only
                responsible for moving the freight to the ground behind the trailer. This
                service is widely available but requires special trucks, so delivery times may
                be prolonged, depending on equipment availability. We recommend customers
                select this service when purchasing particularly heavy or tall items where
                delivery will take place at a location not equipped with a loading dock or
                forklift truck. Our fee for lift gate service varies, depending on the items
                purchased and the delivery location, and will be calculated during the
                checkout process. See the shipping options during checkout or contact our
                office by email at <a href="mailto:sales@primasupply.com">sales@primasupply.com</a>.
                </p>
            <h4>Inside Delivery:</h4>
                <p>
                Inside delivery is the additional moving of freight from the delivery location
                to the inside of a building. "Inside" means it will only be inside the
                building, over the threshold, and away from the loading area, but not
                necessarily to a specific location inside the facility. The service varies
                from carrier to carrier and location to location. Inside delivery does not
                generally include liftgate, so if you need the freight lowered to the ground,
                you will need to add lift gate to inside delivery. Inside delivery does not
                include crossing curbs or ascending/descending staircases; if this is
                required, please contact our customer service team with exact specifications.
                Inside Delivery is not available in all locations, and an extra fee may apply
                for this service. Please contact our office to confirm.
                </p>
            <h4>White Glove Delivery:</h4>
                <p>
                White glove delivery generally involves inside delivery as well as additional
                unpacking and basic installation such as caster installation. This service
                will move the piece to the desired location, remove it from the pallet,
                install casters and dispose of the debris. White Glove Delivery is not
                available in all locations, and an extra fee may apply for the service. Please
                contact our office to confirm.
                </p>
            <h4>Terminal Delivery:</h4>
                <p>
                If you would prefer to pick your equipment up from the freight carrier’s
                delivery terminal, we can instruct the carrier to hold the shipment at their
                delivery terminal. You must pick up the shipment on the business day
                immediately following the arrival of your shipment at the freight carrier’s
                delivery terminal.
                </p>
            <h4>Delivery Notification:</h4>
                <p>
                Our shipping partners offer delivery notification service on all shipments.
                Delivery notification is especially useful if you need notification and
                appointment scheduling prior to delivery. If delivery notification service is
                ordered, the shipping company will contact you by phone before delivery to
                schedule a delivery appointment. We offer this service for you convenience and
                peace of mind. Where others will charge you an additional fee, we provide this
                service at no-charge when requested.
                </p>
        <h3>Damage Claim</h3>
            <p>
            While we do our best to make sure your item arrives pristine and damage-free,
            some items shipped by freight common carrier will occasionally be damaged by
            the freight carrier during transit. To ensure your satisfaction, we require
            you to inspect the shipment for physical damage <strong>prior to accepting the delivery</strong> by signing the delivery
            receipt provided by the freight carrier. If the packaging of the product is
            damaged, do not sign for the item until you have inspected the contents for
            damage corresponding to the damage to the packing. <strong>If a product arrives in a damaged condition, do not sign for the product;
            instead you must refuse the shipment.</strong> Once you have refused the shipment, please contact our customer service team
            at <a href="mailto:sales@primasupply.com">sales@primasupply.com</a> to make arrangements for a replacement. By signing for a
            delivery you are certifying that the shipment arrived in good condition and
            are claiming ownership of the contents. Damage discovered after the shipment
            is accepted by signature is your responsibility to address with the freight
            carrier. We are unable to ship a no-charge replacement once a shipment has
            been accepted. If you have questions during delivery, we encourage you to
            contact our customer service team for assistance at <a href="mailto:sales@primasupply.com">sales@primasupply.com</a>.
            </p>
        <h3>Return Policy</h3>

            </p>
        <h3>Shipping Locations</h3>
            <p>
            In order to better serve you, we will ship your order from one of our
            warehouses or from a vendor partner’s fulfillment center. Direct shipments
            will ship directly from our warehouse located in Louisville, Kentucky. Drop
            shipments will ship from our vendor partner’s fulfillment center. Our vendor
            partners use their own freight and parcel delivery providers. In some cases we
            may be able to specify the delivery carrier, though we cannot guarantee this
            option. Typically, though, the above referenced shipping services and options
            are applicable.
